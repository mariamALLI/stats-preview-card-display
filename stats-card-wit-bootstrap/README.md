## My process
Started the design with grid column from bootstrap which created two columns, then i designed the
empty columns markup classes. After making the skeletal body in both desktop and mobile version,
then i started inserting the other designs the columns were meant to display.
In conclusion, i created the body first to make sure its in order before inputing the rest of the design that the body will in habit.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BootStrap

### What I learned

Learnt the use of background-blend-mode on implementing the background color on the image applied for the design.

### Continued development
Will continue my development on the use of Bootstrap.
Bootstrap documentation also helped knowing how i want the design to appear.
